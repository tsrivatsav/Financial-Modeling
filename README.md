# A Comparative Analysis of Investment Strategies on the Tech Sector Index: A Model-Based Approach

This project aims to compare the historical performance of common financial models
on the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index (^NDXT). We also compare those strategies to the performance of various Machine Learning model architectures to see if we can yield any improvement in performance. We train the models on ^NDXT closing prices from 2007-2016 to predict closing prices from 2017-2023.

## Data
* The project uses historical stock market data obtained from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance python module

## Background
The NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index presents a compelling foundation for financial modeling due to its composition of high-growth technology companies that have shaped both the market landscape and broader economy. Covering the period from 2007 to 2023, the dataset highlights a transformative time for the tech sector -- marked by the growth of giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet, as well as the emergence of disruptive innovators in cloud computing, e-commerce, and AI. This timeframe encompasses the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent tech-led bull market, and the rapid acceleration of digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. By examining the index's progression, this project aims to capture how the underlying companiesâ€™ growth, volatility, and risk profiles may impact the predictive power and profitability of both traditional financial and machine learning-based strategies.
