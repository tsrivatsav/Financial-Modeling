# A Comparative Analysis of Investment Strategies on the Tech Sector Index: A Model-Based Approach

This project aims to compare the historical performance of common financial models
on the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index (^NDXT). We also compare those strategies to the performance of various Machine Learning model architectures to see if we can yield any improvement in performance. Overall, we examine some basic methods that one might think of. 

We first consider a ***Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)*** model in `gbm.ipynb`.
We then move on to a ***Black-Scholes*** and ***Local Volatility*** model for options pricing in `black-scholes.ipynb`.
